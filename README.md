This project is an example of how an University's Secretary site would look like and function with the help of servlets and a MSSQL Database.

### Various Methods that interact with the Databsaw are included :
- Login / Logout
- Sign Up
- Creating Users ( Secretaries , Students , Teachers ) 
- Different menus for each kind of user
- Assigning Courses
- Evaluating Courses
- Checking Average

It is a barebone project but it is a good base to start with and implement more .
